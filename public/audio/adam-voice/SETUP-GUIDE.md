â”œâ”€â”€ G46.mp3
â”œâ”€â”€ G47.mp3
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ O61.mp3
â”œâ”€â”€ O62.mp3
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ O75.mp3
```

## Troubleshooting
### No Sound
- Check that audio files are in the correct folder
- Verify filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure files are MP3 format
- Check browser console for errors

### Wrong Numbers Playing
- Verify filename format: Letter + Number + .mp3
- Check that B1.mp3 contains Adam saying "B1"
- Ensure no extra spaces in filenames

### Fallback to TTS
- If Adam's voice fails, the system automatically uses text-to-speech
- This ensures the game continues working even if some audio files are missing

## Audio Quality Tips
- Keep individual files under 2 seconds each
- Use consistent volume levels across all files
- Ensure clear pronunciation of each number
- Test on different devices and browsers

## Support
If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify all 75 audio files are present
3. Test with a few files first before processing all 75
4. Ensure MP3 files are not corrupted

## Expected Result
Once set up correctly, players will hear Adam's professional voice calling out each BINGO number, creating an engaging and authentic gaming experience! ðŸŽ¯âœ¨
